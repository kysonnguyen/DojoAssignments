            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scrupting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

          <ul id="elements">
              <li><span class="element">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="ex">var x;</span></li>
              <li><span class="element">Assignment operators</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables – our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="ex"> var x = 10</span></li>
              <li><span class="element">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that area JavaScript primitives: Boolean – true or false; nul – nul aka nothing; Number - <span class="ex">42</span> or <span class="ex">3.14159</span>; String – <span class="ex">Coding Dojo Rocks!”;</span> Array – <span class="ex">[1, ‘Coding’, 2, ‘Dojo’];</span> and Object – <span class="ex">{first_name: ‘Jane’, last-name: ‘Doe’}</span></li>
              <li><span class="element">Conditionals</span> Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions – hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="ex">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="ex">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="ex">else</span> we execute this block of code.</li>
              <li><span class="element">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That’s a loop!</li>
              <li><span class="element">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there is a ton more tables to do so let’s call our function over and over and over again.</li>
